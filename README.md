# üéôÔ∏è Podflow

A CLI tool to automate everything related to uploading a podcast episode. It is
highly configurable to your specific needs.

## ü´∂ Features
- üí° Fully configurable - define your own workflow
- üß† Statefull. Each successful step will not be executed again.
- üéñÔ∏è Choose from different services like FTP (Up- and Download), Amazon S3, Auphonic.
- üîñ Create chapter marks independent of audio recording tool.

## üì¶ Installation

Find all the releases [here](https://github.com/floriankimmel/laufenentdecken-cli/releases). Ether
download it there directly or install directly from source with Go's install command

```bash
go install github.com/floriankimmel/podflow@latest
```

## üéôÔ∏è Usage

### üîñ Chapter Marks

During recording you can create chapter marks independent of your recording software. Each mark will be stored in the
state yml of the project

```bash
podflow chapter start | end | add | toggle-pause
```
| Argument      | Description |
| ------------- | -------------------------------
| `start`| Mark the time the recording has started |
| `add` | Add a new chapter mark|
| `end` | Mark the time the recording has ended |
| `toggle-pause` | Start/End a pause. This time will be substracted when exporting the chapter marks |

To export chapter marks to a [Ultrashall](https://ultraschall.fm/), [Podlove](https://docs.podlove.org/) and [Auphonic](https://auphonic.com) compatible format use

```bash
podflow chapter export
```

To start publishing a episode move to the folder containing all the necessary files and run:

### üèÅ Publishing

```bash
podflow publish
```
This will first check if all preconditions are met and afterwards executed each configured step.

To just check if all requirements are met before starting the upload run:

```bash
podflow check
```

## üíª State

Sometimes services are not available and errors can happen. Therefore podflow is statefull and
makes executing the command again and again very easy. Everyting that already happened successfully
will be remember in `{{folderName}}.state.yml` which makes it possible for podflow to continue where it left off.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Metadata
```yml
- metadata:
    episodeNumber: 239
    releaseDate: "2025-01-12 09:00:00"
    title: Test
```
| Argument      | Description |
| ------------- | -------------------------------
| `episodeNumber` | Episode number taken from the configuration and increased by 1|
| `releaseDate` | The actualy spefic datetime when this episode should be release to the public |
| `title` | Title provided by the user |

### ‚úÖ Successfully executed steps

```yml
ftpUploaded: true
s3Uploaded: true
auphonicProduction: true
wordpressBlogCreated: true
downloaded: true
```

If present the associated step has been executed successfully and will not be tried anymore.

### üîñ Chapter marks

```yml
chapterMarks:
   - name: Start
     time: 2024-02-20T13:26:29.597423+01:00
```

If during recording chapter marks were added they are part of the state file ready to be exported

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Loading configuration

By default podflow looks for a configuration in the `$HOME\.config\config.yml` file. If there is a need for different configuration files
the default name `config.yml` can be overwritten by using the environment variable `PODFLOW_CONFIG_FILE`. So by running

```bash
PODFLOW_CONFIG_FILE=test.yml podflow check
```

podflow will load `$HOME\.config\test.yml`.

### General meta information

General information about the release of an episode

```yml
currentEpisode: 240
releaseDay: Friday
releaseTime: "09:00:00"
```
| Argument      | Description |
| ------------- | -------------------------------
| `currentEpisode` | Current Episode number. Will be updated once a new episode has been published |
| `releaseDay` |  Day of the week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday |
| `releaseTime` | Time of day (hh:mm:ss): 09:00:00 |

So episode #`currentEpisode` will be release next `releaseDay` at `releaseTime`.

### Precondition(s)

To ensure everyting is ready to start the upload workflow certain checks can be configured

```yml
files:
    - name: File
      fileName: 'file.m4a'
      required: true | false
